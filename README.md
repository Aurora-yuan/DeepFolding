## DeepFolding
This is an re-implemention of [Jinbo's deep leanring model](https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005324) on protein contacts prediction, which is a breakthrough in protein structure prediction. However, unfortunately they did not open source their codes and models. So I re-implemented theire methods based on the paper. As their paper reported, deep learning model can really improve the accuracy of contacts prediction significantly.
